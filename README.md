# ktn-chat-application
Simple chat server/client


Run the chat application:
------------------------
On server:
python Server.py

On client(s):
python Client.py

Make sure that the IP address and port in Client.py is the same as in Server.py

If you want to run both the server and clients on one machine, you can run the server in one terminal window / command prompt, and open new windows to run several clients.

Currently you should exit all clients using the keyword 'exit' before shutting down the server using Ctrl + C
